I am a Boston-based software developer with over 20 years of technical and professional services expertise with internet-based software including high-performance consumer facing websites. I currently code at [Traackr](http://traackr.com/") which I joined in 2009 as the first engineer. Traackr started as a vertical search engine for marketers and is now evolving into an influencer management platform. Some other highlights:

* I co-founded the Elasticsearch Boston meet-up group: [http://www.meetup.com/Elasticsearch-Boston/](http://www.meetup.com/Elasticsearch-Boston/)
* I've held some talks around big-data and search: [http://www.slideshare.net/gstathis/](http://www.slideshare.net/gstathis/)
